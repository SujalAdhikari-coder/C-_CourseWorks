# CourseWorks_2025

## Overview:
Welcome to the **CourseWorks_2025** repository! This repository contains my college works for the 2025 semester at **The British College**, where I am studying **Cyber Security** and **Digital Forensics**. The project is organized into four coursework assignments, each focusing on different aspects of C++ programming and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts.

## Coursework Breakdown:

1. **Coursework-1**: 
   - Focuses on the basics of C++ programming such as data types, control structures (if-else, loops), and arrays. 
   - Tasks involve implementing simple C++ programs using these concepts.

2. **Coursework-2**: 
   - Covers topics studied from **Week 5 to Week 9**. 
   - Requires developing a programmatic solution using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts in C++.

3. **Coursework-3**: 
   - Focuses on the basics of **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts covered in **Week 5 and Week 6**.
   - Tasks involve solving problems based on inheritance, polymorphism, and other OOP concepts.

4. **Coursework-4**: 
   - Covers advanced OOP topics such as **Operator Overloading**, **Exception Handling**, **Inheritance**, and **Polymorphism**.
   - Requires developing programmatic solutions using these advanced OOP concepts in C++.

## Structure:
The repository contains the following coursework files for each assignment:

1. **Coursework-1**: Tasks related to the basics of C++ programming (data types, control structures, arrays).
2. **Coursework-2**: Tasks involving Object-Oriented Programming (classes, constructors, polymorphism).
3. **Coursework-3**: Tasks based on Object-Oriented Programming concepts like inheritance and abstraction.
4. **Coursework-4**: Tasks involving advanced OOP concepts like operator overloading, exception handling, inheritance, and polymorphism.

Each coursework contains the code and documentation related to the tasks or assignments.
